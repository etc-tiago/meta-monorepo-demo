# Meta Demo

## Commands

`meta init` - start a meta nomorepo

`meta project` - show all projects

`meta project add {name} {git}` - add new project with template

## Limitation at the moment

Meta is not like lerna and does not have a 'new version' command to increase the packages' semantic version; therefore, it is necessary to improve and mature in the future. I will update this repository when that happens.
